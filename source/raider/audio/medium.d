	/* Simulation detail
	 * 
	 * Speakers emit spheres that expand at the speed of sound, a
	 * rough model of real sound waves. Each wave links to a seek
	 * position in an audio source and is part of a list of waves
	 * representing a single continuous audio emission. A list of
	 * these emitted lists comprises the entire soundscape.
	 * 
	 * Listeners are oriented points. Each frame, they are tested
	 * against the waves to find the intervals passing over them.
	 * From the position of the listener and radiuses of the pair
	 * of waves, an interpolated seek time is found.
	 * 
	 * If the interval refers to a sound not yet playing, we seek
	 * to the interpolated time and do nothing. Else, the playing
	 * rate is updated such that the sound will reach the time by
	 * next update. This simulates travel and the doppler effect.
	 * 
	 * Approaching the speed of sound, the condensed wavefront is
	 * modelled with a chain of tapered capsules. Instead of gain
	 * inaccurately increasing to infinity, it falls sharply at a
	 * certain threshold to make way for a sonic boom effect that
	 * is triggered by the listener passing through the capsules.
	 * 
	 * Beyond the speed of sound, waves are not emitted; the boom
	 * is assumed to account for all perceived sound.

	/* Additional notes
	 * 
	 * Listener collision detection is instantaneous, not continuous,
	 * which leads to errors if listeners move too quickly. This 
	 * cannot be avoided but is considered insignificant. Sounds 
	 * may start  to 'clip' with fast listeners, starting late and 
	 * jumping. It is recommended that fast listeners be deafened 
	 * by something, for instance, the roar of an engine.
	 * 
	 * Reflective planes can detect and re-emit waves to simulate
	 * echoing and limited large-scale reverb. How these function
	 * is not yet worked out.
	 * 
	 * Waves are emitted at the start and end of a sound, and for
	 * every significant speaker velocity change. A sentinel wave
	 * is held at the speaker to create an interval with the last 
	 * emitted wave; it represents the 'true' audio being emitted
	 * and is copied to create new waves.
	 * 
	 * Start and end waves refer to seek times outside the valid
	 * range. This is so a stationary listener will cleanly hear 
	 * the beginning and end of a sound.
	 * 
	 * A wave disappears when it and its neighbour's gains are 
	 * attenuated below a certain threshold of hearing.
	 * 
	 * The soundscape has an infinite dynamic range and must be
	 * rendered with an aural equivalent of HDRI tone mapping.
	 * Essentially, loud sounds can silence quiet sounds. 
	 * 
	 * Note to self, do not implement envelope tweaking - use the
	 * real envelope to allow pre-emptive deafening for explosion
	 * emphasis. Storing data for tweaks is too complex.
	 * 
	 * Directional sound is very simple to implement here. Do eet.
