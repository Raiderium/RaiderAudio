    /* Simulation detail
     * 
     * Speakers emit spheres that expand at the speed of sound, a
     * rough model of real sound waves. Each wave links to a seek
     * time in a sound and is part of a list of waves forming
     * a single continuous audio emission. A list of these lists 
     * forms the entire soundscape, and is what Medium stores.
     * 
     * Waves are emitted when a sound starts, stops, changes
     * playback speed, or seeks, and when the speaker changes
     * velocity in the medium (subject to optimisation). There 
     * is an implicit zero-radius wave on the speaker itself.
     * 
     * Listeners are oriented points. Each frame, they are tested
     * against the waves to find the intervals passing over them. 
     * From the position of the listener, a seek time is found.
     * Then the game steps, and a second seek time is found,
     * accounting for the new transform of the listener and 
     * expansion of the waves. From this we infer a playback rate
     * as well as panning, both of which may be smoothed with
     * quadratic splines to improve doppler effects.
     * 
     * If listener and emitter are moving slowly relative to each
     * other, smoothing is not applied, to reduce processing cost.
     * 
     * When a sound is very close to normal pitch, and the
     * play speed is 1, it is not resampled, to improve clarity.
     * 
     * A listener can collide only once with each speaker's list
     * of waves, for performance reasons.
     * 
     * As a speaker approaches mach 1, the condensed wave intervals
     * result in playback rates approaching infinity. To avoid
     * this, gain falls off to make way for a sonic boom effect.
     * 
     * Above the speed of sound, the waves are treated as a chain
     * of tapered capsules, and the boom that occurs when passing
     * across the leading edge is assumed to account for all sound.
     * 
     * Fast-moving objects may have atmospheric sounds attached to
     * them automatically, including a sonic boom. Wave data may
     * be used to drive graphical effects including shockwaves,
     * and physical effects such as impulses from said shocks.
     * 
     * Depending on how closely waves tie into effects, RaiderAudio
     * may be merged into RaiderPhysics.

    /* Additional notes
     * 
     * Reflective planes can detect and re-emit waves to simulate
     * echoing and limited large-scale reverb. How these might
     * work is still undecided.
     * 
     * Collision with waves must be continuous, to cleanly hear
     * the start and end of sounds, and to detect passage through
     * a condensed wavefront. 
     * 
     * A wave disappears when its successor is attenuated below a 
     * certain threshold of hearing.
     * 
     * The soundscape has an infinite dynamic range and must be
     * rendered with HDR techniques. The main consideration is that 
     * loud sounds can silence quiet sounds - not by overpowering
     * them in the mix, but by the rendering actually scaling them
     * such that they contribute nothing to said mix.
     * 
     * Note to self, do not implement envelope tweaking - use the
     * real envelope to allow pre-emptive deafening for explosion
     * emphasis. Storing data for tweaks is too complex.
     * 
     * Directional sound is very simple to implement here. Do eet.
